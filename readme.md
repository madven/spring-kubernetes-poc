if you get:
```

Grant super-user access to all service accounts cluster-wide (strongly discouraged)

If you donâ€™t care about partitioning permissions at all, you can grant super-user access to all service accounts.

Warning: This allows any user with read access to secrets or the ability to create a pod to access super-user credentials.
```bash
kubectl create clusterrolebinding serviceaccounts-cluster-admin \
  --clusterrole=cluster-admin \
  --group=system:serviceaccounts
```

For kubernetes: 
(edit docker image in runner and workload)
`./runner.sh -gn`

For istio: 
(edit docker image in runner and workload)
(edit greeting-service in workload from LoadBalancer to NodePort)
`./runner.sh -gni`
